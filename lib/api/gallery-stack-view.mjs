// its own; stacks come back only once the query is cleared. Every other
// filter (category, favorites, scopes, …) keeps the collapsing behavior.
// Both the gallery list endpoint and the incremental gallery-rows
// reconciliation route their `collapseStacks` decision through here, so the
// list and live sync can never disagree about stacking.

// (`stackCoverAnnotations: false`), so a matching cover is listed as a plain
