# Privacy

MOSA is a local-first creative asset library. It does not operate a MOSA cloud library, advertising system, or remote user account. Packaged desktop builds send the bounded anonymous usage signal described below through a bodyless request to the same first-party release endpoint used for update metadata; usage reporting and update-manifest parsing are separate operations.

## Data MOSA Reads

Depending on the features you enable, MOSA may read:

- generated media under the configured Codex generated-image root;
- matching local Codex session records used to recover Prompt and provenance;
- media and matching `chat_history.jsonl` records under the configured Grok sessions root;
- the dedicated MOSA Cowart canvas and explicitly approved project canvases;
- ChatGPT web images and message-scoped context sent by the optional Chrome extension;
- user-visible generated images from Gemini, Flow, and Google AI Studio sent by the same extension; Gemini may additionally send the nearest preceding visible `user-query` within the generated image's local message structure, Flow may send one uniquely anchored visible Prompt card, and AI Studio may send the nearest preceding visible user Prompt turn in the same chat session. Each is marked as unverified.

MOSA does not intentionally scan Downloads, Desktop, unrelated project folders, arbitrary browser pages, or source roots outside the documented allowlists.

## Data MOSA Stores

The selected local MOSA library can contain:

- original image or video bytes;
- WebP previews and thumbnails;
- Prompt and user-message text;
- hashes, dimensions, timestamps, source paths, source type, model/tool information, and provenance;
- version relationships, tags, archive state, and collection metadata;
- for web capture, provider/page URL, capture time, capture mode, extension version, Prompt provenance/source/scope, a MOSA-derived Prompt-priority value used only to prevent lower-quality provider fields from overwriting better ones, observed generation status when exposed by the page/runtime, and bounded source-occurrence history; ChatGPT additionally records conversation/message identifiers and observed image-tool call, generation-call, response, or provider-asset identifiers when those values are explicitly present in the page/runtime data and, when the live page stream exposes it, the Prompt text of the image-tool call (what ChatGPT's chat model sent to the image generator), stored separately from the caption Prompt;
- generation events separately from deduplicated media assets. A generation event can contain a MOSA-created `capture_context_id`, provider runtime identifiers when observed, a verification level, Prompt fields and scope, observed generation status, references, and evidence. A MOSA capture-context ID is never represented as a provider generation-call ID.

Reference images identified by Web Capture are stored as private generation-record attachments under the selected MOSA library. They are content-hash deduplicated and may be linked into the subsequent generated asset's recipe snapshot, but they are not ordinary assets and therefore do not appear in the gallery, search, recent items, or asset totals. MOSA does not infer the purpose or rights of a reference from its pixels.

A recipe may also record rights declarations for the reference images it used: copyright state, portrait-consent state, redistribution state, an attribution string, and the purposes the reference may or may not serve. These are entered by the user, not detected. They can concern identifiable third parties, so an attribution name is personal data and the library should be treated accordingly. MOSA never infers consent: every field starts at `unknown`, and silence is never recorded as permission.

The library is stored on the user's machine. MOSA does not upload it to a MOSA-operated service.

User-initiated exports of group metadata (the sidebar group context-menu "Export Group" JSON download) stay metadata-only: the exported file contains file names, Prompts, tags, groups, categories, ratings, business fields, source types, and timestamps, and the export strips every local file path and directory (managed originals, previews, import source paths), every `/library/...` URL that only resolves against the local MOSA server, and web-capture page/media links such as `page_url` and `source_media_url`, so the file can be shared without disclosing your user name or directory structure. Fields are dropped by name only — a business field whose key ends in `_path`, `_url`, or `_dir`, or is named `path`, is also dropped, while all other business fields are kept verbatim.

## Anonymous Usage Metrics

Desktop builds send minimal anonymous usage metrics so the project can measure whether releases are actually being installed and retained. This telemetry is limited to the bounded fields below and is not exposed as an in-app preference; it can be disabled locally by launching MOSA with the `MOSA_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1` environment variable.

MOSA stores a random UUID in Electron's local `userData` directory. The UUID is generated by MOSA and is not derived from a device serial number, account, filesystem path, hardware fingerprint, Prompt, asset, or source-tool identifier.

Every desktop launch makes sure this UUID exists: it is created locally on the first launch, reused unchanged afterward, and displayed in the app's user center. When telemetry is disabled (`MOSA_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1`), or in a development or QA run, the UUID is only stored and displayed locally and is never sent. The set of reported fields is unchanged.

At most once per calendar day in the `America/Los_Angeles` time zone, packaged MOSA Desktop may send a bodyless HTTPS request to `https://mosa.azhuilab.com/releases/latest.json` containing the following bounded fields. While the app remains open, it rechecks eligibility every 15 minutes. This usage request is independent of where the installer was obtained (for example, the MOSA website, GitHub, or a directly shared package):

- event type: `first_launch` or `daily_active`;
- telemetry protocol version: `2`;
- the random installation UUID;
- MOSA version;
- operating-system family: macOS, Windows, or other;
- CPU architecture such as `arm64` or `x64`.

MOSA does not attach library contents, asset counts, Prompt text, filenames, local paths, browser history, provider conversation identifiers, email addresses, names, or account data to this request. A failed usage request is not counted as a successful usage report. Manual update checks do not create extra activity reports. Upgrading from the previous 24-hour protocol permits one report under the new protocol while preserving the existing installation UUID.

The website can also retain a short campaign label such as `ref=reddit_codex` on a download URL so aggregate download traffic can be attributed to the page or creator that referred it. MOSA does not require a login for attribution.

## Desktop application updates

When you check for or install an application update, packaged MOSA reads `https://mosa.azhuilab.com/releases/latest.json`. If you explicitly choose **Download and install**, macOS and Windows builds download only the platform-specific update artifact advertised by that manifest from `https://mosa.azhuilab.com/downloads/`. MOSA does not attach your library contents, images, videos, Prompts, provenance records, search queries, library paths, or Visual Pack embeddings to the update download. Update files are staged locally under Electron `userData`, verified by declared byte size and SHA-256, and used only to replace the application itself; `MOSA Library` and its original assets remain outside the application replacement transaction.

## Optional Visual Pack download

Local visual search is optional. When you explicitly choose Install or Update in Settings, MOSA reads the first-party release manifest at `https://mosa.azhuilab.com/releases/latest.json` and downloads the published platform-specific Visual Pack only from `https://mosa.azhuilab.com/downloads/visual-packs/`. These requests necessarily reach the download server, but MOSA does not attach your images, videos, Prompts, provenance records, library paths, search queries, or derived visual embeddings to the request. Pack files are verified and stored locally under Electron `userData`; they are not placed in or uploaded from `MOSA Library`.

Removing the Visual Pack deletes the local optional model/runtime and derived visual relationship index. It does not delete or modify original library assets, Prompt text, or provenance records.

## Optional C2PA helper download

C2PA Content Credential export can use an optional `c2patool` helper pack. The desktop installer component is implemented and tested, but no desktop UI entry point ships it to end users yet; when a future release wires that entry point, this section describes exactly what will happen. MOSA reads the signed first-party release manifest used by application updates — signature verification is mandatory in code, not optional — and downloads the platform-specific helper only from `https://mosa.azhuilab.com/downloads/helper-packs/c2patool/`. These requests do not include your images, videos, Prompts, provenance records, library paths, search queries, signing keys, certificates, or credentials. The downloaded helper is verified locally by pinned file sizes and SHA-256 hashes before it becomes active.

MOSA does not download `c2patool` directly from GitHub on end-user machines. Upstream binaries and license files are consumed only by MOSA's release preparation process, then redistributed as a pinned first-party helper pack.

## Web Capture Chrome Extension

The optional extension:

- defaults automatic capture to off for a new installation and opens its settings page so the user can review the capture disclosure before enabling it; upgrades preserve the user's existing local preference;
- runs only on the ChatGPT, Gemini, Flow, and Google AI Studio domains declared in its manifest;
- observes ChatGPT page and generation-response data to associate an image with the correct message-scoped Prompt and event-scoped conversation identifier and, when an image-generation result follows a user turn containing uploaded images, may archive those uploads as private reference attachments before the generated asset; provider asset identifiers are retained per observed reference usage when available, so a later generation can be compared against earlier Generation Events without turning that comparison into a confirmed relation;
- reads, while the user has a ChatGPT conversation open, the structure of the conversation data the page itself loaded — the message order, roles, and image file ids of the displayed branch — so MOSA can label which turn each archived image belongs to. Only identifiers and numbers are reported: the conversation id, the user-message id of the producing turn, the turn index and total turn count, and image file ids. Conversation text, prompts, titles, image or download URLs, edited-away branches, and conversations the user has not opened are never read and never sent; the extension never requests conversation data on its own. The same structure is sent at most once per browser session per conversation, only to the paired loopback MOSA, and not at all without a paired token;
- records ChatGPT web observations as `observed`, not as provider-API-verified provenance. MOSA may locally score relation candidates from reference identity, modification-like user instructions, same-conversation order, and timing, but these remain `inferred` candidates until the user confirms or dismisses them; message order alone never creates a parent/child generation relation;
- may fetch generated image and supported video bytes from the OpenAI- and Google-hosted asset domains declared in its manifest; redirect destinations are re-validated against the same media-host allowlist, and the original plus final media URL may be retained as local provenance evidence;
- sends captured data only to the configured loopback MOSA address;
- receives its Web Capture Token through a loopback pairing request that MOSA Desktop accepts only from the two fixed allowlisted MOSA extension origins; Desktop pairing is automatic and silent, while headless CLI runtimes keep pairing disabled by default unless their owner explicitly opts in;
- stores the MOSA address, Web Capture Token, auto-capture preference, and a bounded retry queue for unresolved capture jobs in `chrome.storage.local`, not synchronized storage. The queue is retried by a Chrome alarm and is removed after MOSA acknowledges the capture or after its bounded retention period. Later terminal status or higher-quality Prompt metadata updates the existing queued job rather than creating an independent stale replay;
- reports a bounded retry-queue diagnostic snapshot to the paired loopback MOSA runtime so the desktop Settings view can show pending/retrying capture work. This snapshot contains at most 20 queue entries and is limited to a local capture key, provider, media kind, Prompt-status label (not Prompt text), generation-status label, queue timestamps, retry-attempt count, and the bounded local error message. It does not include Prompt/user-message text, page URLs, media URLs, cookies, account identifiers, or captured media bytes. The runtime keeps this diagnostic state in memory; it is refreshed by the extension and is not a second delivery queue;
- accepts a local retry-request counter from MOSA Desktop. The counter does not contain capture content and does not move ownership of queued jobs into the desktop runtime; the extension remains the only component that replays its durable queue;
- temporarily stores page-local `blob:`/Base64 media needed by queued jobs in the extension's local IndexedDB. Image media is stored as a Blob referenced by the retry queue; large page-local videos are stored as bounded ordered Blob chunks rather than one in-memory object. These records are deleted after MOSA acknowledges the capture, when the user/extension aborts the transfer, or when the associated bounded retry job expires or is evicted;
- transfers large page-local generated videos to the extension worker in bounded chunks and later sends the queued chunks to MOSA through its local upload-session endpoints rather than one whole Base64 JSON message. Remote HTTPS videos continue to stream directly to the MOSA upload session without being retained as one whole video in extension memory.

When the user explicitly enables the optional **capture diagnostics** switch in the extension settings, the page hook additionally keeps a three-minute, 400-frame-per-conversation ring buffer of structural observations from SSE patches, WebSocket frames, and the conversation-related `backend-api` responses the page itself loaded. Each frame is reduced to field paths, JavaScript types, string lengths, and a small allowlist of primitive values (model slug, content type, message role, the author name of tool messages only, recipient, channel, status, event types, SSE patch operation names, endpoint paths with IDs replaced) — dialogue text, prompts, user messages, titles, filenames, URL query parameters, cookies, tokens, and signatures are never recorded. The ring buffer is discarded the moment the switch is turned off or the page reloads; only the summary of one capture window is written to `chrome.storage.local` when an image is archived without its prompt. At most 50 records (each capped at 200 KiB; oversized ones are truncated and flagged) are retained on the user's machine, never sent to MOSA or anywhere else, and can be exported as a JSON file or cleared from the extension options page. About 1 in 10 prompt-bearing captures is recorded as a `control` sample with the same structural scope to make diffing meaningful.

Its manifest host permissions are limited to the following explicit hosts/patterns: `chatgpt.com`, `chat.openai.com`, `*.oaiusercontent.com`, `images.openai.com`, `*.blob.core.windows.net`, `gemini.google.com`, `labs.google`, `flow.google.com`, `aistudio.google.com`, `*.googleusercontent.com`, `*.ggpht.com`, `storage.googleapis.com`, `generativelanguage.googleapis.com`, `flow-content.google`, plus loopback `127.0.0.1` and `localhost` for delivery to MOSA. The Azure Blob host is used for provider-served media bytes and is not a MOSA-operated endpoint.

For captured videos, MOSA may store media dimensions, MIME/type information, byte size, and `durationSeconds` when the provider-visible media metadata exposes a usable duration. This field is local provenance metadata and is not transmitted to a MOSA cloud service.

When updating from an earlier prerelease extension, existing settings may be read once from Chrome synchronized storage, copied to local storage, and removed from synchronized storage. The known prerelease development Token is discarded rather than migrated.

The extension does not request or store an OpenAI API Key or ChatGPT password. It operates inside the user's existing browser session, so each provider and its asset hosts remain governed by their own privacy terms.

For ChatGPT late-caption recovery, the page-world hook may make a same-origin request for the currently open conversation using the browser session already available to that page. The extension does not read, copy, store, post, or replay ChatGPT Authorization headers or related authentication request headers. If the same-origin request is not sufficient, the image remains archived and the Prompt may remain unavailable.

On Gemini (`gemini.google.com`), it may additionally capture only the nearest preceding rendered `user-query` associated with a visible image inside a `model-response`. It skips inputs, editors, hidden content, unrelated page regions, credentials, cookies, and API keys. This text is marked `provider-visible-prompt` and is not verified as the prompt actually executed for generation.

On Google AI Studio (`aistudio.google.com`), it may additionally capture only the nearest preceding rendered user Prompt turn within the same `ms-chat-session` as a visible generated image. It skips controls, inputs, editors, hidden content, model thoughts, other sessions, cookies, credentials, and API keys. This text is marked `provider-visible-prompt` and is not verified as the prompt actually executed for generation.

On Flow (`labs.google` / `flow.google.com`), it also may capture the one visible Prompt card structurally associated with a visible generated-image group, but only when the card has a unique nearby `Reuse Prompt` control. This text is marked `provider-visible-prompt`, is not verified as the prompt actually used for generation, and is never collected from an input, editor, hidden content, cookies, credentials, or the page as a whole.

## Network Boundary

The MOSA service binds to `127.0.0.1` and is not designed for public exposure. MOSA does not add remote synchronization. The desktop shell's only MOSA-operated analytics signal is the bounded usage metadata sent through the separate HTTPS request described above.

Codex, ChatGPT, Grok, Cowart, Chrome, and any AI or image-generation provider used before an asset reaches MOSA are separate products. Their own network behavior and privacy policies still apply.

## User Control

- In the desktop app, choose **Settings → Storage & data → Change location** to move the local library to an empty folder. MOSA copies the existing assets and metadata, switches the saved location only after the copy succeeds, and then restarts.
- `MOSA_LIBRARY_DIR` remains an explicit runtime override. When it is set, it takes precedence over the saved desktop location and the in-app move control is disabled.
- Disable web capture by leaving `MOSA_WEB_CAPTURE_TOKEN` unset and disabling or removing the extension.
- Disable a source bridge by not configuring or running the corresponding source tool.
- Back up the library before migration, repair, or manual removal.
- Do not commit the library, Tokens, Prompts, session records, or generated media to the source repository.

MOSA archive actions are organizational and do not promise secure erasure. Filesystem backups, browser data, source-tool histories, and copied media must be managed separately.
